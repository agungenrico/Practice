Day 1 of training SmartGit/VCS (Version Control System).

Intrudoction.
VCS (Version Control System) is about methodlogy of recovery on your work.
This is easily to recover and allows you to revert files back to a previous 
state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes 
over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem,
who introduced an issue and when, and more.

VCS Consist of two type :
Centralized VCS and Distributed VCS.

Distributed method is more strongth and safe than Centralized method.
Every document in local can shared by local, not using server. So, when
connection get error we do not worried get lost the document.
